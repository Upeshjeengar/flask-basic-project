# This is a Basic Machine Learning Project 
## This is my first flask app
I had used <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshrau/social-network-ads">this </a> data and applied **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a customer will buy my product or not.  
I had downloaded my model(You can view code <a href="https://github.com/Upeshjeengar/flask-basic-project/blob/main/3_LogisticRegression.ipynb">here</a>) using **pickel** and imported it to use.
